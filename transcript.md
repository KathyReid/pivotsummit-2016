## Introduction

SLIDE: Introduction

Good afternoon everyone, and thanks *NAME* for that excellent introduction. I know it's pretty late in the afternoon, and many of you have travelled considerable distance to be here, so a huge thank you for coming to the beautiful city of Geelong - my home town - and for sticking around for the afternoon sessions.

I'm Kathy Reid, and I work at the intersection of emerging technologies, open source and technical communities - an incredibly interesting field to work in. I'm basically a professional geek who gets paid to work bringing people and technology closer together - and that's a good thing.

The title of my talk today - "They're jobs, Jim, but not as we know them" - is very deliberately intended. If you think of some of recent job titles emanating from Silicon Valley - like *Cloud Architect* or *Big Data Visionary* or *Clickthrough Analyst*, they seem almost surreal. As we hear daily reports of increasing automation and artificial intelligence, you could be forgiven for thinking that jobs of the future are from another planet, unrecognisable, almost ... alien.

SLIDE: Alien

So, over the next 30 minutes, I'll be leading us on a *mission*. A mission to learn, to explore, understand, and hopefully learn to engage with these alien jobs of the future.

SLIDE: Mission

We're going to take a look at;

* Some of the macro-economic factors that are driving shifts in jobs
* Some of the technology trends that are re-shaping jobs
* And we'll take a look at the skills that will be needed to secure employment in the future.

My intent is that you, as individuals or as businesses, will be able to use the key takeaways today to help think about how *you* might respond to the changing nature of jobs.

## Back, back in time

First though, I'm going to jump in the time machine and explore for a moment what jobs of the past looked like. If we have a look at how jobs have evolved over time, it will give us insight into how they're likely to evolve in the future.

SLIDE: Rat Catcher

So, being a Rat Catcher was a lucrative role in 1830s Kent - there were plenty of rats, which were carriers of pestilence such as the plague - and while the OH&S standards weren't very high, if you had elite dexterity skills, you could make a pretty penny. This role was like many of that time - piece-meal - you got paid based on the number of rats you caught.

SLIDE: Switchboard Operators

If Rat Catching wasn't your thing because, say, you were a woman and equal opportunity had't been invented yet (!), then you might tip your hand at being a manual switchboard operator. Again, this required good physical stamina, and precision and accuracy, but on the plus side it paid by the hour.

Obviously, both of these jobs have died out, but through differing mechanisms. Rat catchers for instance lost business because better sanitation and public health environments, urbanisation -  reduced the rodent infestation. Switchboards on the other hand became automated through technology advancement - PABXs.

## Two drivers of jobs growth - population and technical advancement

SLIDE: Drivers of Australia's economic growth

So, while these two jobs - rat catching and switchboard operating - might have died out decades ago, there are similarities with the forces which are in play today. While urbanisation and technical advancement may have ended the career of the rat catcher and switchboard operator, it is these two forces which are likely to drive Australia's jobs growth in the future.

So, let us continue our mission and explore a little more around what those jobs are going to look like.

## 7 Job Clusters

SLIDE: Job Clusters

In their recent report, the Foundation for Young Australians urged young Australians not to think in terms of specific careers, but around a professional portfolio of skills - job *clusters* that they can use to drive their professional development.

* *Generators* - these are jobs that require a high level of interaction - think about roles in retail, in sales, entertainment and hospitality - our 'people people'.

* *Artisans* - these are the jobs that require manual and dexterity skills - construction, production and maintenance. Builders, plumbers, electricians and tradie type roles are all in this cluster.

* *Carers* - nurses, doctors, personal trainers, and all the roles that provide personal health and well being services.

* *Informers* - our informers are those roles that involve professionals providing information, education or business services - for instance university lecturers, accountants, business advisors and so on.

* *Co-ordinators* - our co-ordinators are our back of house heroes - administrative and service workers who are often behind the scenes.

* *Designers* - these are the jobs that require skills in science, maths, engineering, lots of the STEM roles - engineers, architects, industrial designers and so on.

* *Technologists* - these are my people - the geeks of the world - roles that require skilled understanding of technology and digital systems.

If we apply this thinking to some of the careers that we might be familiar with, we get some exciting possibilities.

For instance, take an architect - part of the Designer cluster. The skills required for architecture - design, understanding of form and function, utility with materials - all of these skills equally apply for instance to industrial design, or indeed user experience design or even customer experience design. So in the future you may simply be a Designer - and work across a range of domains.

Similarly with the Carer cluster - we can see many crossovers between say medicine and nutrition or nursing and psychological health.

## Demand for skills

SLIDE: WEF skills trends

But of course, the market demand for these skills is not equal at all.

When we look at what skills the World Economic Forum predicts will be required in the next 3 years to 2020, some clear trends emerge. Some of the skills that are predicted to be in highest demand are

* cognitive abilities - the ability to harness science, technology, engineering and design skills, identify and act upon new insights - and to *think*

* systems skills - the ability to conceptualise processes and components, how they fit together and interact, and how to make them better

* complex problem solving skills - to solve the *wicked* problems of the future - requiring research, analytical, experimental and entrepreneurial skills.

* content skills - not just business writing, but *engagement* skills - the ability to present convincingly, articulately and with passion - for instance in front of people - or in social media or virtual reality or augmented reality channels.

* social skills - empathy, emotional intelligence, the ability to work productively and harmoniously with other humans - will continue to be an in demand skill - particularly as globalisation and generational shifts in the workplace mean that we'll be working with people of all ages, cultures and backgrounds.

* technical skills - these will remain in high demand, but as automation and artificial intelligence continue to advance, these skills will move from the doing side of technology - more to the conceptual and design side.

* physical skills - the demand for physical skills - dexterity, physical strength and stamina - will continue to decline, other than in industries where physical strength provides a distinct advantage - such as in building and construction.

## Education and training

So, if we take into account the











## Relationship between wages and productivity

SLIDE - Relationship between wages and productivity

And if we look at the relationship between wages and productivity over time, we see this play out at a macro-economic scale. Since the 1970s, wages - and this is true for all OECD economies - wages have been stagnant when compared to output and productivity.

This trend is set to continue as artificial intelligence and automation advance even further.





## How have the jobs evolved?

## Distopia vs Utopia

SLIDE: Distopia vs Utopia

So, there's really two polarised views about the future of work. On one side we have the utopian view - that automation and the rise of AI will generate limitless new opportunities for employment in a range of exciting fields - nanotechnology, artificial intelligence, genetics, agricultural technology, automated transport and so on. This is tempered by the pessimistic view that advances will cause massive dislocation of employment - by both volume, sector and geography.

The reality of course lies somewhere in between these two extremes, specific to individual industries, regions and occupations.

## Industries and occupations

So, let's examine more closely which industries and occupations are most likely to be affected.

@TODO - something in here around the WEF report on changes in the labour market

## Fourth industrial revolution

SLIDE: FOURTH INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION


## Skills shortages

WEF shows that there will generally be talent shortages across the board. We cannot wait for the next generation to become skilled - we have to take an active role in training for our digital future.

## Key drivers of change

Putting our mission suits on, and getting our instruments to examine Jobs of the Future, we can already make some observations about how the labour landscape is changing.

### Changing work environments

How many people here work from a co-work space? Quite a few, great! In fact, Knight Frank, a Melbourne real estate company recently reported that over the last year, there's been a 750% increase - that's 7 and a half times - growth in space being used for co-working in Melbourne. This is driven not just by smaller businesses and entrepreneurs, but also by more flexible work policies in corporate environments - telework, remote work and so on - and the underpinning technologies required to work in this way. Co-working also has the benefit of being able to mix and mingle - and be exposed to thoughts, ideas or skills that you wouldn't be able to if you were in a smaller office.

We're also seeing a rise in people working from home - not just instead of working in a corporate office, but also running small businesses from home - and why wouldn't you - you pay rent or a mortgage on a premises, and you're away from it, not occupying it, for the whole work day.

### Rise of Asia and the middle class

At a global level, we're also seeing a rise of Asia, China, India, Indonesia, all with burgeoning middle classes. China has a population of over a billion, India is approaching a billion and Indonesia has a quarter of a billion. Australia has a population of just 25 million. If you're making a product or delivering a cloud service, why would you go after the smaller market? This means that businesses based in Australia are likely to be engaging more with Asia, and of course that's a challenge. How many people here speak an Indian language - Hindi or Urdu or can read Devanagari, or Mandarin or Cantonese or Bahasa? Having an Asian language under your belt is going to give you an edge in an increasingly global world.

So, with our investigative hats on, we can see that both of these trends are going to shape *WHERE* we work and *WHO* we work with.

### Climate change and natural resource scarcity

Of course, climate change is going to impact jobs of the future too.

It's OK, I won't take an hour here debating whether the science is right - let's just presume that 99% of the world's leading scientists and their myriad expertise is actually correct - climate change is going to impact on our working lives. It's going to be hotter, wetter with more extreme weather events. It will be harder to grow produce - which will impact the agricultural sector significantly.

Climate change will also damage infrastructure - fires, floods and extreme heat cause billions of dollars of damage every year - and the money needed to repair that infrastructure means it won't be invested in other areas.

Paradoxically though, that renewal creates additional jobs.

## Schumpeterian Paradox - Creative Destruction

SLIDE - Creative Destruction

And here I want to diverge just briefly into a concept that underpins many of the jobs of the future - the Schumpeterian Paradox of Creative Destruction.

As new technologies and approaches advance and disrupt different sectors, they disrupt established business models, economies - and importantly - roles. So for instance as PABXs revolutionised the switchboard, switchboard operators were no longer required, but PABX technicians were. Of course, a PABX doesn't need as many technicians as the switchboard needed operators, so there's a net loss of jobs - because technical advancement has increased productivity - output - without creating additional jobs.

## Working note-takers



end of life care - end of life jobs - euthanasia planner - this sits at the intersection of aging and health care, but also a growing recognition of the role that mental health and wellbeing plays in a life well lived.

Talk about the intersection of a number of key trends, and what this means for jobs of the future.

## The Gig Economy

Jobs are becoming more contingent
Shorter term contracts
Lack of real wages growth
Many people overqualified for the roles that they are filling
? Are degrees undervalued
Rise of short courses or just in time learning
Example of Javascript fatigue - Javascript frameworks are evolving moe rapidly than ever, hard to keep up - even if you studied Javascript or programming at Uni,

Knowledge has a shorter shelf life

## Skills required in the future

Complex problem solving
Collaboration



## Too many graduates, people are overqualified for their roles

** how will this bookend with Dineli Mather's talk on graduates: wanted **

Is education and training really the answer?

## Different types of jobs in the future

Five different kinds of jobs from the Bernard Salt report

* The Care-givers
* The Technocrats
* The Specialist Professionals
* The Doers
* The Creatives


## Rise of AI and automation

Impacting white collar and middle class jobs
Administration heavily impacted

Are we seeing a return to bespoke and artisanal manufacturing?

*AI-rtisans*

^^^ love this concept - how long is it before AI is able to replicate or even build on original works by humans - we've seen Google's deep dream neural network be trained on various artists and then 'imagine' its own artworks.
