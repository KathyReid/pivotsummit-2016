## Session outcomes

So, what can you expect to get out of this Session?

Well, aside from the guaranteed 10XP, you have the chance to pick up a Rare or even Epic tip on how to develop a plan for your open source career that's in alignment with your personal values, that leverages your personal strengths and which addresses the skills you're not _quite_ legendary in yet.

We'll spend some time exploring how to learn more about what your superpowers are, and how you can grow new ones. We'll learn not just about the technical repertoire a kick-ass open source ninja has, but the conceptual and interpersonal skills required to level up your career. We'll look at skill trees so that you can build a path to follow in your professional development.

I'll talk a little bit about social capital, what it is, and how it influences your career.

## Game Plan

I'd like to ask you all a question.

 * How many of you knew, right from high school, that you wanted to be an open source developer?
 Great!

 * How many of you had a plan from high school to get the grades to get into Uni, take the right subjects, and then get the right job at the right company?
OK.

* And how many of you kind of fell into the role that you're in at the moment without any sort of defined career plan?
OK, I see

- and what might be a completely unrelated question - how many people here have played a role playing game like dungeons and dragons, or Magic the Gathering, or World of Warcraft, something like that ?

SLIDE: Initial HabitRPG character

So, the first thing that you often do in those sorts of games is to work with your character - understand their strengths and weaknesses and then develop a game plan - a strategy - that your character can use to make the most of the environment they find themselves in and the resources they have around them.

Real life is very similar.

Any Minecraft fans in the audience? Do you remember the very first time that you played Minecraft? And you didn't chop down enough wood in time, and you didn't build a shelter, and the monsters came and ate you in the middle of the night?

Yeah, real life's kinda like that ;-)

SLIDE: Game Plan

That's right - you need a game plan for your career!

## Rolling your character

So, how do you find out what sort of character you are?

SLIDE: Know thyself

As Matrix fans - and I'm sure there's a few in the audience - might recognise - the Greek message there reads 'Know Thyself' - and by better understanding your own character and makeup, you can build a career path that's right for you.

The fact that you're at a brilliant conference like this already suggests a few things about you - you're probably highly intelligent, interested in the way that things work, you may have a penchant for freedom, for analysis and deep technical interests.

But, we need to dig a little deeper to find out how knowing about your character can help you advance your career.

### Motivations

SLIDE: Motivations

Different people - different characters - are motivated by different things.

There are two key types of motivators - external motivators - and intrinsic motivators

SLIDE: External and intrinsic motivators

**External motivations**

External motivation means that the things which motivate us come from the outside. The desires to perform a task or reach a goal are driven by an outside source. Examples of extrinsic motivators include things like performance bonuses, other types of monetary rewards, recognition such as employee of the month awards, organised team activities and so on.

Without the external stimulus, you would be less likely to expend the effort or skill required to reach the goal.

_Joke_

If I give you a chocolate, will you put your hand up for me?

**Intrinsic motivations**

Intrinsic motivators are much more complex - they're internally driven. They're much more difficult to control and utilise - but they're also much more powerful.

There's a range of different intrinsic motivators - social acceptance, social status, honour, pride, and importantly I think for this audience - curiosity.

Think about someone you've worked with in the past who took pride in their work - the task they were actually doing may have been small, or trivial, or unimportant in the scheme of things - but they took care to make sure it was done well - pride in workmanship is a motivator.

Think about a team you've worked in where the morale was high or where there were strong friendships within the team - and it felt great to go into work and just see those people - social acceptance and belonging are key motivators. We see this frequently in open source communities - particularly groups like hacker spaces - where community grows over time. If people don't feel welcomed into a project or a community, and one of their key motivators is social acceptance, they're not going to stick around for very long.

You've probably also worked in a situation where curiosity motivated an outcome - finding a way to build something, figure something out, pull it apart and improve it - driven not by financial reward but by intrinsic curiosity - and here's a recent example;

SLIDE: POTUS congratulating Ahmed for building a clock

When you think about what gets you up in the morning, what you're really passionate about - these will be clues to what motivates you. The key takeaway is that often, intrinsic motivators are more important in choosing where and how to level up your career than external ones. If you choose projects and organisations and teams that align with your personal internal drivers, you're much more likely to be motivated and fulfilled - and to put in discretionary effort to achieve higher skill levels.

_Joke_

So, let's try this again - no chocolate this time.

Who's going to put your hand up, because you want me as a Speaker to believe that you're an amazing audience?

Awesome! My gosh, you're an amazing audience!

#### Flow states as a motivator

Motivation is really interesting when you apply it to open source endeavours - often people are not paid for the contributions - and I mean that in the broadest sense - to open source software, communities and events. There's actually been empirical research done into this, and the authors - Lakhani and Wolf - found that one of the key motivators for people contributing to open source projects was something called 'flow state'.

Flow state occurs when you're working on something that's not too easy and not too challenging - the level of the task matches your competency level. Remember when you were first using the shell and it was a bit confusing, but now you can sed and awk like a boss? Well, that's flow state.

Over time, you might find that using these tools is so easy for you that to do so will result in boredom - you need something more challenging to keep you engaged - and in 'flow state'.

SLIDE: Flow State

When you're learning new skills, it's important to keep flow state in mind - it can be really frustrating if you're learning something new and it's difficult - it can really put you off. So, next time you're facing a challenge, thinking about where you are in the Flow State Diagram  can help you break down the task or the learning objective, and help you understand where your level of competency is at.

If you'd like to learn more about these topics, there's a full reference list at the end of my presentation.

## Growth mindset

A closely related concept that's particularly helpful for career development is that of having a 'growth mindset'. A lot of the work in this space was undertaken by a researcher called Carol Dweck, and her research examined the difference between having a fixed mindset and a growth mindset.

SLIDE: Growth mindset vs fixed mindset

REFERENCE: Dweck - Can Personality be changed?

We've probably all worked with someone who regularly says something along the lines of "I'm just not good at (something - for argument's sake, let's say coding) - there's no way I'm ever going to be good at it". Because they hold this mindset, they don't even bother trying to learn more about whatever the thing is, rather than at least attempting to learn a little about it.  

By contrast, people with a growth mindset have the belief that even if they aren't good at something now, that with effort, and practice, and using feedback from constructive criticism that they can get better at something over time - they will actually put the effort into getting better.

So, in thinking about levelling up your open source career, think about whether you need to tweak your mindset a little first.

SLIDE: HabitRPG level two.

## Learning styles


SLIDE: VARK Styles

So, now that you have a growth mindset, and you really do want to learn, and grow and upskill, what's the best way to do that?

Different people have different learning styles, and VARK is a good way to explore what learning style suits you best. There's many different questionnaires you can do online for VARK - a quick Google search wil unearth them, so I won't cover that here.

The key takeaways though are that understanding your preferred learning style means that you can then better understand which courses, and learning materials, you're going to get the most out of.

* Visual - visual learners like charts and graphs - they absorb information visually. Videos, diagrams, animations - these are the go to tools for visual learners.

* Aural - aural learners learn by listening, and by speaking things through. They will be big fans of pod casts, and of listening material.

* Reading and writing - these learners absorb information through both reading and writing. They will be avid readers and note-takers - and I can see a few Reading learners in the audience today.

* Kinesthetic learners learn by doing, through moving and undertaking the action or the skill. Often people who are very good at sports, or outdoor activities are kinesthetic learners.

## Skill trees

So, now that you know what sort of character you are, and what motivates you, and how to strive to have a growth mindset, we can start to tackle the Game Plan side of things.

So, what can RPGs teach us about this? Let's take a look again at some examples from the gaming world.

SLIDE: Character Skill Tree #1

We can see here a very classic sort of skill tree - you can go in one of four basic directions with your abilities, and within that direction there are individual skill sets or skill groups that have to be mastered to advance to the next level.

These skill groups exist in your real life career tree as well, and we'll talk a little bit about what they look like shortly.

SLIDE: Character Skill Tree #2

This one is one of my personal favourites - I've spent way too much time becoming familiar with the skill sets in this game - it's The Secret World. Within this game, you don't have to choose just one specialisation, you get to choose two, and they're often complementary - so you could for instance have pistols teamed with elemental magic, or blade skills teamed with blood magic. As we'll see, the same is often true of real life. Well, not the blade skills, or the elemental magic part - usually - I make an exception for jQuery - but having complementary skillsets which are greater than the sum of their parts.

Just like these different character classes, you have to have a defined plan - a skill tree - in order to level up.

 Skill trees articulate which specialisations, groups of specialisations - and importantly - dependencies - you have to have in order to 'unlock' or achieve higher levels - or in our case - more senior roles.

 ---

### A framework for open source skillsets

One of the most generic approaches to building skillsets is the one shown here - where you have technical, conceptual and interpersonal pieces overlapping.

SLIDE: Technical, interpersonal and conceptual overview

And you can see from this diagram that it's really the overlap of these three areas that provides the most robust set of complementary skills - and indeed to grow your career you'll need to ensure that you develop skills from each of the three areas.

Generally speaking, the more senior you are in your career development, the less that technical specialisations count, and the more that your interpersonal and conceptual skillsets carry weight instead.

And here are some of the examples of skills that fit into the three different generic categories.

SLIDE: Technical, interpersonal and conceptual detail table

- Technical

These are the specialist skills - often related to specific products or platforms. They often require a high level of detailed knowledge about specific systems and how they work. They tend to be acquired in individual settings, and can often be self-taught or learned on the job.

- Conceptual

These tend to be thnking skills - and often deal with frameworks, lifecycles, processes, maturity models - and how they touch each other, and relate back to strategies and objectives. They tend to be acquired in group and organisational settings, and often require formal training, and also mentoring and coaching.

- Interpersonal

These are often the most difficult group of skills to acquire - and they deal with not only with the management of self, but with building, growing, negotiating and leveraging networks of relationships. They're often the most overlooked group of skills. They generally require mentoring, coaching, and significant investment to grow.

### Classes within open source

So, putting some of these tools together, let's explore what skill trees and character classes might look like in the open source space.

These classes aren't perfect - they're a starting point - and over time what I'm hoping to do with these is iterate them into an artefact that can be used to help those who are newer to open source communities plan their career directions - and of course, open source them.

## Kernel hacker

SLIDE: Kernel hacker

This lady has deep internal knowledge of Linux systems - she's able to reverse engineer drivers, knows how to handle memory well, is able to figure out efficient and effective methods of storage and file system. In order to succeed, she'll need strong programming skills in a low level language like C.

Conceptually, she will need to have a strong grasp of both reverse engineering and root cause analysis / component failure impact analysis and so on.

On the interpersonal side, this sort of role is likey to be challenging in terms of the community it deals with - and the interpersonal skills you would need here include strong resilience, and ability to engage with a strongly opinionated community.

---

## Front end developer

SLIDE: Front end developer

This lady is dynamite with D3. She can whip up some HTML on the smell of an oily rag. She knows when to Ember, when to React, and when to Angular, and when to realise not to use them all together. In one minified file, goddamit!

Conceptually, she will need great design skills, user experience skills. Important, project management is very important for many different classes of open source.

Interpersonally, she'll need great empathy and interviewing techniques, so that she's able to accurately elicit requirements from her clients.

---

## Data scientist

This lady is 150% awesome, with a very high confidence level. Skilled at both statistics and visualisation, she knows programming languages and tools for statistical analysis and vistualisation.

Conceptually, she will have an understanding of different statistical processes, and when each of them should be applied.

Interpersonally, she'll be skilled at building narratives around datasets, and using these narratives to influence decision making

---

## Other skill sets

I could go on in this vein for a while - with archetypes such as hardware hacker, community leader, full stack developer, sysadmin and so on, but I'll stop there for now.

The key takeaway here is that you need to understand what sort of general shape your career will have, and which different technical, interpersonal and conceptual skills you need to acquire to get to the next level.

Ideally, what I'd like to see over time is a standard way of representing open source career archetypes - as a kind of planning tool. Tools such as the Skills For the Information Age take an enterprise-wide view of the IT skills needed to successfully run an IT organisation, and I'd like to see something like that developed to help support open source career development.

---

## Defending your character

So, now that you know what sort of character you are, and you have an idea about the sort of skill tree that you'll be following for your career path, you need to give some thought to what sort of professional reputation you want to uphold. Do you want to be known as honourable? diligent? an obnoxious but occasionally useful genious? The choice is yours.

In RPG parlance, this is kind of like figuring out what sort of alignment you hold - are you chaotic good - kinda disorganised but generally good to be around - are you lawful evil - you totally understand the system, but also how to exploit it.

SLIDE: Donna Benjamin

If somebody puts your photo up at a conference and asks, is this lady going to get the job done - are they going to say 'hell yes'?!

Hell yes!

Remember, every interaction you have with someone is an opportunity to enforce your professional reputation - or lose it.

Even though you may have a well thought out career plan, things don't always go to plan. In your career, you're likely to have setbacks - failures, scandals, negative press coverage by rubbish journalists. The way to recover from such set backs is not to be deterred. Stick to your character, look for opportunities to again prove your value, and move forward.



## Building up your professional posse

So, once you know what sort of character you are, what motivates you, what sort of character class suits you best, and what technical, conceptual and interpersonal skills you need to level up, you then need to think about something called SOCIAL CAPITAL.

- SLIDE: Professional posse

Social capital is the intangible value you create and leverage through your professional and personal networks. Research - and again I have references - has shown that professionals who have strong relationships and networks are promoted more frequently than those who have smaller professional networks. The statistics vary, but the consensus is that many job openings are not openly advertised - they're recruited from what's called a passive or hidden market. And how are candidates on the passive market found - through their relationships and connections - through social capital.

The thing to remember is that networking isn't a dirty word. Think of it like you would any one of your other professional skills like C, or javascript, or arduino. Networking is a skill, and by practicing it, you can get better at it. It doesn't mean that you need to be inauthentic, or you that you need to be a person when deep down you're not. What it does mean is that you have a genuine curiosity about what people do, how they do it, how you can learn from it, but also how you can add value to what they do. Think win / win or mutual value.

There's about 100-200 people in the room at the moment, yeah? How many people when you walked into the room introduced yourself to someone you didn't know? And how many made an introduction between two people who you knew, but who didn't know each other? Bonus XP for that! These are all examples of social capital. So, be a capitalist - a social capitalist!

REFERENCE: Seibert et al

In the room today is likely to be someone who will at some point in your career be able to offer you a new opportunity. And remember from the piece I've just covered - every interaction is a job interview. Makes you think differently about the conference, doesn't it?

### Mentorship vs Sponsorship

- SLIDE: Mentorship vs Sponsorship

One thing I'd like to quickly mention on the topic of social capital is the difference between mentoring and Sponsorship.

How many people here have had a mentor in the past? And did you find that process useful? Help you navigate an organisation, introduce you to a project and how it works. Great!

So, mentorship is great, and I don't for a second want to detract from the practice of mentoring, or being a mentee. But what I would like everyone to think about is the difference between mentorship and sponsorship.

A mentor introduces you to the organisation or to the project. A sponsor introduces you to the CEO of the organisation or the project lead - and makes sure that they know your name. A sponsor opens doors for you, makes you aware of learning and development opportunities, and ensures you are considered for promotion.

Sponsorship is a whole another level above mentorship.

How many people have had a mentor?

Think about this from the viewpoint also of the Sponsor - sponsorship is a whole another level above Mentoring, so the level of investment that the Sponsor needs to make is a whole another level as well - so if you're seeking a Sponsor, really think about the commitment they're going to be making in you.

- REFERENCE: Friday et al

### Putting it all together

So, in summary, if you're looking to level up your open source career, you need to think about;

* having a game plan for your career
* understanding your motivations
* understanding how you learn best
* understanding what sort of archetype or pattern you want to adopt
* planning out a skill tree
* building your professional network
* and gaining a mentor or sponsor

Thank you for listening today, and I'd now like to award you all 10 XP!
Level up :-)
