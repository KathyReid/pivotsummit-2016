## Working note-takers



end of life care - end of life jobs - euthanasia planner - this sits at the intersection of aging and health care, but also a growing recognition of the role that mental health and wellbeing plays in a life well lived.

Talk about the intersection of a number of key trends, and what this means for jobs of the future.

## The Gig Economy

Jobs are becoming more contingent
Shorter term contracts
Lack of real wages growth
Many people overqualified for the roles that they are filling
? Are degrees undervalued
Rise of short courses or just in time learning
Example of Javascript fatigue - Javascript frameworks are evolving moe rapidly than ever, hard to keep up - even if you studied Javascript or programming at Uni,

Knowledge has a shorter shelf life

## Skills required in the future

Complex problem solving
Collaboration

## Different types of jobs in the future

Five different kinds of jobs from the Bernard Salt report

* The Care-givers
* The Technocrats
* The Specialist Professionals
* The Doers
* The Creatives


## Rise of AI and automation

Impacting white collar and middle class jobs
Administration heavily impacted

Are we seeing a return to bespoke and artisanal manufacturing?

*AI-rtisans*

^^^ love this concept - how long is it before AI is able to replicate or even build on original works by humans - we've seen Google's deep dream neural network be trained on various artists and then 'imagine' its own artworks.

## Introduction

SLIDE: Introduction

Good afternoon everyone, and thanks *NAME* for that excellent introduction. I know it's pretty late in the afternoon, and many of you have travelled considerable distance to be here, so a huge thank you for coming to the beautiful city of Geelong - my home town - and for sticking around for the afternoon sessions.

I'm Kathy Reid, and I work at the intersection of emerging technologies, open source and technical communities - an incredibly interesting field to work in. I'm basically a professional geek who gets paid to work bringing people and technology closer together - and that's a good thing.

The title of my talk today - "They're jobs, Jim, but not as we know them" - is very deliberately intended. If you think of some of recent job titles emanating from Silicon Valley - like *Cloud Architect* or *Big Data Visionary* or *Clickthrough Analyst*, they seem almost surreal. As we hear daily reports of increasing automation and artificial intelligence, you could be forgiven for thinking that jobs of the future are from another planet, unrecognisable, almost ... alien.

SLIDE: ALIEN

So, over the next 30 minutes, I'll be leading us on a *mission*. A mission to learn, to explore, understand, and hopefully tame, jobs of the future.

SLIDE: MISSION

We're going to take a look at;

* Some of the macro-economic factors that are driving shifts in jobs
* Some of the technology trends that are re-shaping jobs
* And we'll take a look at the skills that will be needed to secure employment in the future.

My intent is that you, as individuals or as businesses, will be able to use the key takeaways today to help think about how you might respond to the changing nature of jobs.

## Back, back in time

First though, I'm going to jump in the time machine and explore for a moment what jobs of the past looked like. If we have a look at how jobs have evolved over time, it will give us insight into how they're likely to evolve in the future.

SLIDE: RATCATCHER

So, being a Rat Catcher was a lucrative role in 1830s Kent - there were plenty of rats, which were carriers of pestilence such as the plague - and while the OH&S standards weren't very high, if you had elite dexterity skills, you could make a pretty penny. This role was like many of that time - piece-meal - you got paid based on the number of rats you caught.

SLIDE: SWITCHBOARD OPERATORS

If Rat Catching wasn't your thing because, say, you were a woman and equal opportunity had't been invented yet (!), then you might tip your hand at being a manual switchboard operator. Again, this required good physical stamina, and precision and accuracy, but on the plus side it paid by the hour.

Obviously, both of these jobs had died out, but through differing mechanisms. Rat catchers for instance lost business because better sanitation and public health environments, urbanisation -  reduced the rodent infestation. Switchboards on the other hand became automated through technology advancement - PABXs.

## Two drivers of jobs growth - population and technical advancement

So, while these two jobs - rat catching and switchboard operating - might have died out decades ago, there are similarities with the forces which are in play. While urbanisation and technical advancement may have ended the career of the rat catcher and switchboard operator, it is these two forces which are likely to drive Australia's jobs growth in the future.



## How have the jobs evolved?

## Distopia vs Utopia

SLIDE: Distopia vs Utopia

So, there's really two polarised views about the future of work. On one side we have the utopian view - that automation and the rise of AI will generate limitless new opportunities for employment in a range of exciting fields - nanotechnology, artificial intelligence, genetics, agricultural technology, automated transport and so on. This is tempered by the pessimistic view that advances will cause massive dislocation of employment - by both volume, sector and geography.

The reality of course lies somewhere in between these two extremes, specific to individual industries, regions and occupations.

## Industries and occupations

So, let's examine more closely which industries and occupations are most likely to be affected.
